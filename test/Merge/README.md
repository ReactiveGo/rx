**Merge** combines multiple Observables into one by merging their emissions.
An error from any of the observables will terminate the merged observables.

## Example
Merging two streams of ints generated by FromInt. The result will be
perfectly interleaved. The Trampoline scheduler used by Println for
subscribing together with the specific way FromInt is implemented
will create a repeatable (deterministic) test run with ideal merge
behavior.
```go
import _ "github.com/reactivego/rx/generic"
```
Code:
```go
a := FromInt(0, 2, 4)
b := FromInt(1, 3, 5)
MergeInt(a, b).Println()
```
Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
5
```
