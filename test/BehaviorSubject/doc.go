// NewBehaviorSubject returns a new BehaviorSubject. When an observer
// subscribes to a BehaviorSubject, it begins by emitting the item most
// recently emitted by the Observable part of the subject (or a seed/default
// value if none has yet been emitted) and then continues to emit any other
// items emitted later by the Observable part.
