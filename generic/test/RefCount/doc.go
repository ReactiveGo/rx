	RefCount http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/refcount.html

RefCount is a declarative way of calling Connect on a Connectable. It is an
operator on Connectable that returns a normal Observable. On first Subscribe
it will call Connect on its ConnectableFoo and when its last subscriber is
Unsubscribed it will cancel the connection by calling Unsubscribe on the
subscription returned by the call to Connect.

As long as the source Observable of a Connectable has not completed, the calls
to Connect and subsequent Unsubscribe will create and cancel the subscription
from the Connectable to its source. If the source is a cold observable, this
means that the same data will be generated by the cold observable repeatedly.
But because this happens on the first subscribe, subsequent subscriptions may
not see the data depending on the type of Connectable RefCount is called on.
