//jig:name ObserveFunc

// ObserveFunc is the observer, a function that gets called whenever the
// observable has something to report. The next argument is the item value that
// is only valid when the done argument is false. When done is true and the err
// argument is not nil, then the observable has terminated with an error.
// When done is true and the err argument is nil, then the observable has
// completed normally.
type ObserveFunc func(next interface{}, err error, done bool)

var zero interface{}

// Next is called by an Observable to emit the next interface{} value to the
// observer.
func (f ObserveFunc) Next(next interface{}) {
	f(next, nil, false)
}

// Error is called by an Observable to report an error to the observer.
func (f ObserveFunc) Error(err error) {
	f(zero, err, true)
}

// Complete is called by an Observable to signal that no more data is
// forthcoming to the observer.
func (f ObserveFunc) Complete() {
	f(zero, nil, true)
}
